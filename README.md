This project analyzes technical indicators for a given stock, using stochastic processes, relative strength index, and moving average convergence/divergence strategies. 
Using multiple python packages such as streamlit, I created an interface for this tool to be much more user freindly.
The user can input a stock ticker, and in turn is given a summary of that companies trading history, a dataframe of their buy and sell signals, and a graph of he stock price with buy and sell signals.
